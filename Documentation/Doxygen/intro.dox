\page intro Introduction

FEBio is a finite element solver that is specifically designed for three
dimensional biomechanical applications. It solves the nonlinear finite
element equations using a quasi-Newton method called the BFGS-method. It
offers  biologically relevant constitutive models and modeling scenarios.
