* Fix the restart feature:
- FETransverselyIsotropic: need to remove m_plc parameter.
- serialize data records
- support for FEBio plot file
- serialize surface loads
- serialize body forces 
- how to serialize FERigidBody::m_pDC + FERigidBody::m_prb
- surface load should call FESurface::Serialize instead of serialzing surface data
  actually, they should not even serialize surface data at all since the mesh takes care of that

* I should probably split the FEPressureLoad into two separate classes, one for the linear pressures and one for the nonlinear.

* Is the FEPressureLoad::Clone function needed?
* Is the FETractionLoad::Clone function needed?

* I think the pressure stiffness flag can be removed since the linear pressure loads basically ignores the stiffness as well.

* Should I move the FESolidSolver::AssembleResidual and AssembleStiffness to the FESolver class?
