* Fix the restart feature:
check the following routines:
-FEMaterial::Save: Need to call FEM::AddParameterList
-FETransverselyIsotropic: need to remove m_plc parameter.

* define an INRANGE macro that allows you to specify whether the bounds are included or not

* I should probably split the FEPressureLoad into two separate classes, one for the linear pressures and one for the nonlinear.

* Is the FEPressureLoad::Clone function needed?
* Is the FETractionLoad::Clone function needed?

* I think the pressure stiffness flag can be removed since the linear pressure loads basically ignores the stiffness as well.

* Should I move the FESolidSolver::AssembleResidual and AssembleStiffness to the FESolver class?
